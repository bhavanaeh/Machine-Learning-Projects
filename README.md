# Machine Learning Projects
My attempt at learning machine learning by building basic projects.

# Breast Cancer Detection
- This is a pretty simple data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data
- Using 10 features of biopsy, classifiying whether it is cancerous(malignant or benign tumor) or not. 
- Used the pandas library to explore and prepare the data. 
- Plotted the distributions and correlation matrixes of each feature.
- Used K-nearest neighbors and suppor vector machine classifier
- Got an accuracy of 98% for the KNN model
